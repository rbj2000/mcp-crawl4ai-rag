# Ollama AI Provider Support - Brownfield Enhancement Epic

## Epic Goal
Add Ollama support for embeddings and LLM operations with configurable embedding dimensions to provide local AI processing capabilities alongside existing OpenAI integration, enabling cost reduction, privacy compliance, and flexible model selection.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- **Current functionality**: OpenAI API integration for text embeddings (fixed 1536 dimensions) and LLM processing across all RAG operations
- **Technology stack**: Python MCP server with OpenAI client, configurable database providers
- **Integration points**: Utils module for embeddings, vector database storage, contextual processing, model configuration via environment variables

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added**: Ollama client integration with configurable provider selection (OpenAI/Ollama) and **dynamic embedding dimension configuration**
- **How it integrates**: Environment-driven provider factory pattern with embedding dimension detection/configuration, similar to existing database provider architecture
- **Success criteria**: Support local embeddings and LLM with configurable dimensions, seamless provider switching without data incompatibility

## Stories

### Story 1: Configurable Embedding Dimensions & Ollama Embedding Provider
### Story 2: Ollama LLM Provider Integration
### Story 3: Provider Configuration, Migration, and Testing

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing OpenAI functionality remains unchanged
- [x] Database operations handle variable embedding dimensions
- [x] MCP tool interfaces remain identical
- [x] Environment variable configuration follows existing patterns
- [x] **Dimension mismatch detection prevents data corruption**

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk**: Embedding dimension mismatches causing vector search failures or data corruption
- **Mitigation**: Implement dimension validation, clear configuration warnings, dimension detection on startup, migration guidance for dimension changes
- **Rollback Plan**: Environment variable switch back to OpenAI, dimension validation prevents incompatible embeddings

## Definition of Done
- [x] Ollama embeddings working with configurable dimensions
- [x] Ollama LLM processing matches OpenAI capabilities  
- [x] Configuration allows seamless provider switching (with dimension compatibility)
- [x] **Embedding dimension validation prevents data corruption**
- [x] All existing tests pass with both providers and different dimensions
- [x] Docker support includes Ollama integration
- [x] Documentation updated with Ollama setup and dimension configuration instructions
